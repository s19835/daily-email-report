# daily-email-report
Using Node.js and the nodemailer package, automate daily email reports by writing a script to configure and send emails with attachments. The script can be scheduled to run daily using cron on Unix-based systems or Task Scheduler on Windows. This setup requires installing the nodemailer package and creating a script to handle email sending.
