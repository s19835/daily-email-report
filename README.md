# daily-email-report

Using Node.js and the nodemailer package, automate daily email reports by writing a script to configure and send emails with attachments. The script can be scheduled to run daily using cron on Unix-based systems or Task Scheduler on Windows. This setup requires installing the nodemailer package and creating a script to handle email sending.

## JavaScript: Using Node.js and Nodemailer

Step 1: Install Required Libraries

- First, you need to install the nodemailer package. You can do this using npm: `npm install nodemailer`

Step 2: Write the JavaScript Script

- Here's an example script using Node.js and Nodemailer to send an email with an attachment:

Step 3: Schedule the Script

- You can use cron on Unix-based systems or Task Scheduler on Windows, similar to the Python example.

On Unix-based Systems Using cron

Open the crontab file for editing:
` crontab -e `

Add a new cron job to run the script daily at a specified time (e.g., 8 AM):
`0 8 * * * /usr/bin/node /path/to/your/script.js`

On Windows Using Task Scheduler

Open Task Scheduler and select "Create Basic Task".
Follow the wizard to set the name, description, and trigger time (daily).
For the action, select "Start a Program" and browse to your Node.js executable.
Add arguments: the path to your script.
Finish the wizard and ensure the task is enabled.
